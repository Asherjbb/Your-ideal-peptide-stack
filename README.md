# Your-ideal-peptide-stack
This project is an interactive, research-driven web application designed to help users identify which peptide/ peptide stack is most optimal for their health, performance, and appearance based on specific biological profiles, health issues, and performance goals input by the user. The then best stack/ peptide will be generated for the user's viewing, with a detailed description of why this specific peptide is best for you, as well as the synergy of the peptide stack, if any, along with a detailed description of the peptide itself. The project will also include an interactive library of every known peptide with a photo that, when clicked on, shows an in-depth description for the viewer.
